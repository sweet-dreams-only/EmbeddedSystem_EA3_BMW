V1.05.02 contains the following additional features:
====================================================
- Remapping the address range of the Star08 from physical to linear
  addresses. The Vector flash botloader supports only the download of
  addresses in linear address space. THus, if your hex file output
  from the linker is organized in physical address ranges with banked
  address ranges, you need to remap them to linear addresses using Hexview.
  This can be done either through the menu option "Edit" -> "Remap S08  Phys->Lin"
  or through the commandline using the option '/s08map'.

- V1.05.02 now tolerates the Intel-HEX record 05 when reading an Intel-HEX file. 
  This record may contain the start address within the HEX-file. However,
  Hexview does not store and re-generate this value back again.
  Any Intel HEX-File generated by Hexview will not contain a record type 05.

- Multiple files can now selected when using the post-build file select option.

- CANoe traces in ASCII format can now traced with Hexview. The trace scan is 
  restricted to traces for diagnostic purposes, mainly used for flash download.
  You first should select the ASCII trace file. Afterwards, select the CAN channel,
  the CAN-identifiers for physical addressed request and response messages and the 
  protocol used for the download. Three different options are available here for selection.
  Select KWP2000, UDS or a GMLAN download for a trace.
  Now you can run the CANoe trace. Depending on the selected verbosity level more or 
  less information will be generated into the output window. The contents of the window 
  can be written into a CSV file, which i turn can be fed to Excel for further detailed
  analysis.
  If the "Scan data" checkbox is selected, hexview also tries to scan the address and length
  information from RequestDownload and scans the data from TransferData.
  If data could be scanned and are available, they can be inserted into the internal
  Hexview data buffer to store or compare them against the originally downloaded files.

- A Geny-output file may be used to specify the fill address regions for the fill options.
  You may use the component "GenTool_GenyPluginConfigDocumentor" to generate a full 
  XML file containing all Geny configurations. Do not select the "Ignore Default Values" option.
  The Generated XML file can then be used to read the allocated segments to fill them.
  Please note, that the GNY-file may not contain all section information. The default values
  are normally not placed into the GNY-file.
